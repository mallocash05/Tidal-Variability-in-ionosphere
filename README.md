# Tidal-Variability-in-ionosphere
We have done this project in my 5th semester in the group of two student. We have been concern with Machine Learning and Data mining through this project

1.Extraction of Data from NetCDF(.nc) file. Data contained  electron density , longitude ,latitude variables.
2.Binning of data from extracted data.
3.Data anticipation with machine learning tool(using regression).anticipation is required because at some points data are missing.
4.Finally plot the graph and examine the result with original.
5.All parts implemented in python.
